This is the detailed supplementary information for the paper <Simulating the magnetic fields generated by piezoelectric devices using FEM software: Beyond the quasi-static approximation> .

In this paper, we developed a method to simulate the magnetic field in/around a piezoelectric material. Which means, <u>there is no quasi-static approximation involved</u>. This method in principle can be applied to any finite-element method softwares, as long as they are based on weak forms. We use <u>COMSOL</u> as an example.

If you are interested in this method and decide to use our method in your research, please cite our paper using the link below:

# Instructions

We wrote a step-by-step instruction about how to build such a simulation from zero (or from a template), and it can be found in the links below ⬇️

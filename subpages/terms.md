On the model tree, every physics is called an ***interface***.

Also on the model tree, every line is called a `node`.

When you click on a `node`, a menu will show up on the right.

The electric/magnetic fields within the piezoelectric devices are called internal electric/magnetic fields.

The electric/magnetic fields outside the piezoelectric devices are called external electric/magnetic fields.
